Plugins are components, that process messages based on rules.
Note: Gates are plugins too, but they are described in gates.txt

Plugins use the PluginInfo as identifier.
The GUID must be unique and the plugin name should be too (for usability).
see guid.txt for more Informations

Predefined plugins in BitCenter:
These plugins are predefined and cannot be used as GUID

{INT.TRIM.X}
This plugin can trim messages to a specific size.
It can remove excess bytes and add a custom message
to inform about truncation of the message.

{INT.IF.X}
Probably one of the the most useful plugins.
This plugin has exactly two outputs. The first
signals true, the second signals false. Depending
on a condition, a message may take either output
but never both.
Output decisions can be based on:
Subject, From, To, Body, Length
Conditions are (including their complement):
Contains, BeginsWith, EndsWith, IsNumeric, Matches*
*) Regular expression matching

{INT.TIMER.X}
Generates a Timer message at a specific interval.
The interval can be changed: if a service message is received
the interval is changed to the number in the subject.
Other messages are just routed through it.

{INT.APPE.X}
Appends a string to an incoming message.

{INT.DUPE.X}
Outputs every incoming message twice to every output.

{INT.HOLD.X}
Holds back every message until a timer service message is received.
