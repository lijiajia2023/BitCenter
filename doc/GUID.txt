Required GUID Format: {Global.Local.Number}

Format:
3 values seperated with a dot.
Values may contain any chars, numbers and symbols that build up valid file names.
Dots and {} are not allowed.
The values are case insensitive and are internally converted to uppercase.

Global
A string that should be developer specific
to prevent Plugins from different developers to have
name conflicts. Must not be "INT", which signals an internal Plugin

Local
A plugin specific string.
This prevents the same plugin to be started multiple times

Number
This is an integer type number that is free to choose withhin the Int32 range.
A plugin should have a hardcoded number to prevent it to be started multiple
times. The IPlugin.Init(Form,int) function can be used to start a second
instance of a plugin, if the plugin supports so, otherwise the function
should return false.

Example: {AyrA.AddressFilter.1}
