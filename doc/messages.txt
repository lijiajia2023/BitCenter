Messages are (as the name suggests) Bitmessage messages.
Additionally a message can be flagged as service message.
Service messages can control the operation of gates and plugins.
Service messages are not processed by gates, they never leave the
application.

There is nothing special to messages. Each field of it can be
changed by any plugin or any gate except the ID.
